#  Sorting Algorithms



## Selection sort

**selection sort**, algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.
The subarray which is already sorted.
Remaining subarray which is unsorted.
In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.

Properties:

Worst-case performance O(n^2)                                          
                                Best-case performance O(n)             
Average case performance O(n^2)

## Insertion sort


**Insertion sort** is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

Properties:

Worst-case performance O(n^2)   
Best-case performance O(n)   
Average case performance O(n^2)
